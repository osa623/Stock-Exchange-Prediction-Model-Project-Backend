For this report layout 

at first  when i uploaded the pdf it should identify below topics from the pdf pages and then for every layout it should extract values under 'Group' tag not company and there are two years So this model should get those values for those 2 years but prepare the final text for seperate years 

Income Statement
Financial position statement
Clash flow statement

according to the target_schema_bank file those values should be printed
